==================
Workspace Switcher
==================

Workspace Switcher provides a quick and easy way to step through your monitors
on a Windows(R) environment without the need to reach for your mouse (or other
pointing device).

Workspace Switcher is able to do so by registering a hot key with windows and
listening to it. When a hotkey event is received, it steps through your
monitors, one monitor per hotkey. When your last monitor is reached, the
program selects your first one again.

Warning
=======

Unless you have a multi-monitor setup *and* use some kind of focus-follow-mouse
feature on Windows (I recommend the "True X-Mouse Gizmo for Windows", you might
not be able to fully enjoy the benefits of this program.

Hotkey
======

The default hotkey combination is the Windows Logo + Esc and the only way you
can change that is by changing the program's source code.
